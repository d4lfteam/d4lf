These files are all autogenerated from data from d4companion and d4data. 
Any manual additions to them will be overwritten the next time that data is updated.

If you want to add data to these files, do the following steps:

1) Download the latest version of d4data: https://github.com/DiabloTools/d4data.git
2) Download the latest version of d4companion: https://github.com/josdemmers/Diablo4Companion
3) Run [gen_data.py](/src/tools/gen_data.py). You provide the paths of the above two dowloads. For example, 
you might run: `python gen_data.py C:\Users\you\code\d4data C:\Users\you\code\Diablo4Companion`

If you do not see the new data you're expecting to see, you need to add it to the appropriate custom_* file. These files store any additional data that we were not able to find in d4data for any reason.

You can find the custom files in [src/tools/data](/src/tools/data). For example, if you need to add a new aspect, you can add it to custom_aspects_enUS.json.

After adding your custom data, run gen_data again and ensure your asset file looks how you expect. Open a PR after.
